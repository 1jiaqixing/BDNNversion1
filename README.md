# BDNNversion1
BDNNs grow autonomously without backpropagation.  supporting continual learning and knowledge transfer without catastrophic forgetting.  Tested on a neuromorphic tactile object-classification task, BDNNs achieved accuracy comparable to BP-based SNNs while learning 1â€“3 orders of magnitude faster. continual learning in tactile sensing,
